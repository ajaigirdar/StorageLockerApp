1. I have make sure that I put an exception so that the user cannot enter more than available locker.
2. it kept prompting user for locker number multiple times. Other than that, it's pretty much working.
3. Fixed the for loops in accessLocker() and releaseLocker()
4. Adding switch to the menu options
5. the app seems to be working. adding all 10 locker options back in the arrays
