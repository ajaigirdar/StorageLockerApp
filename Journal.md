1. I have make sure that I put an exception so that the user cannot enter more than available locker.
2. it kept prompting user for locker number multiple times. Other than that, it's pretty much working.
3. Fixed the for loops in accessLocker() and releaseLocker()
4. Adding switch to the menu options
5. the app seems to be working. adding all 10 locker options back in the arrays 
6. generated random numbers in int but taking input from user as string. converting int to string so i don't have to redo methods.
7. now I have to store random pins into an array.
8. add initializeLocker method which will store random pins to the lockerPin[].
9. project complete.
